A typing test is a method of measuring an individual's typing speed and accuracy. The test typically involves typing a passage of text as quickly and accurately as possible within a certain time frame. The results of the test are typically measured in words per minute (WPM) and errors. Typing tests are used for various purposes, such as evaluating an individual's typing skills for job requirements or as a personal measure of improvement. Some websites offer online typing tests, where you can take a test and get an instant score. Here is GUI of the same.
